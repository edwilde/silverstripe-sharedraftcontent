# Share draft content

The [Share draft content](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-sharedraftcontent/) module provides the ability for SilverStripe users to share draft page content with non-CMS users.

This enables CMS users to generate a private link which can be shared securely with anyone. Each preview link is valid for 30 days.

## Viewing the shared draft page

Navigating to the shared link will allow you to view the draft state of the page.

<div class="note" markdown="1">If you navigate away from the shared draft page you will be taken to the published state.</div>

Pages appear in two states:
* Draft state contains content which is yet to be published. While viewing draft pages, a message will appear to inform you of this.
* Published state contains content which has been published. As a result, you will not be notified of this, and will see the live version of the site.
